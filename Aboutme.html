	Hello, my name is Joseph De La Portilla, I am a sophomore from Pasadena High School thats in The App Academy. The App Academy
    is a four year program, that starts from when you fist enter high school, til you graduate high school. This is
    currently my second year in The App Academy and I love it, I love learning about all these different
    lines of code, commands, classes, id's, ect. too many to name.

<br>
<br>
 I'm 14 years old play baseball, video games, love learning about code, and putting it in to play in
    my own customizable way. I play baseball here at Pasadena High and it's fun and a good workout. I've
    been playing baseball since I was 5 and I never had had this much excersize in my life. Ever since I
    heard about The App Academy I wanted to join as soon as I got the chance to.The App Academy has quite a bit
    of perks, from getting to go during school days to go see people code for work, to getting to go to
    Microsoft and be part of a Hack-a-Thon. It's the best class of the day(by far) and everything about it 
    is just great. When I get older I hope to be able to code for a living and making a great life out of it.
    To help shape the future, just like all of the great teachers I've had, a big thank you to them for helping
    me so much. This website I'm making right now you're reading this on, would not have been possible...without
    The App Academy.
